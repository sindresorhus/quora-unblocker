> Chrome extension - Removes the login requirement and any nagging about it

Quora has a quite obscure way to view content [without logging in](http://blog.quora.com/Making-Sharing-Better) by appending `?share=1` to the url. This extensions appends that to every Quora url you visit in addition to removing some annoying login nags.

## Install

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quora-unblocker/pcjnlebeogfamlbeloiccdidgmaeojhe) or [manually](http://superuser.com/a/247654/6877).
